They are often found bridging the gap between native apps and web and so will strive to make the UI look and behave like an app. <em>Which app?</em> you may ask. <em>iPhone? Android? What version?</em> All good questions, alas another topic altogether. However, there is another kind of front-end developer, the <em>boring</em> front-end developer. Here is an ode to the <em>boring</em> front-end developer, <em>BFED</em> if you will.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"browser-support\">Browser support</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The BFED realises that while not all experiences will be identical, all browsers <em>can</em> be used to consume a website, even <em>gasp</em>, IE6 and below. He/she will promote Progressive Enhancement and Cross-browser (not Multi-browser) scripting at any given opportunity. The BFED also realises it is not a feat to drop support for a particular (set of) browser(s) and understands that forgetting about the existence of those users hurts them and their perception of the company/product.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"preprocessors\">Preprocessors</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>When given the choice to add a preprocessor (e.g. LESS, SASS, CoffeeScript etc) to the technology stack, the BFED realises there is a deeper impact beyond just \"writing less code\". <em>Will it be harder to onboard developers? Will debugging code be more difficult?</em> If the answer to any of these (<a href=\"http://adamsilver.io/articles/the-disadvantages-of-css-preprocessors/\">and many other</a>) questions is <em>yes</em> then the BFED will say <em>no</em> to preprocessors.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"accessibility\">Accessibility</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The BFED realises that users have different abilities and preferred ways of using a device, whether its a mouse, finger, thumb, screen reader, keyboard or a combination of all, websites should be consumable no matter the audience, screen size or capability of the browser.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"ui-design\">UI design</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The BFED embraces the constraints and limitations of the browser so that he/she doesn't find him/herself in a world of Adaptive Design and UA sniffing because that world is horrible, ill-advised and costly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is best to include the BFED early on in the UX design process to save wasting time designing a UI that should ultimately be avoided (see <a href=\"http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/mobile/fixed-position/\">Position Fixed</a> and <a href=\"http://adamsilver.io/articles/select-menu-accessibility-issues/\">Select Menu Accessibility Issues</a> for more on that) and that can likely be designed more simply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The BFED will also suggest the use of native form controls realising that browsers will enhance the experience where possible, particularly on mobile, and doesn't try to control the look and feel too much as he/she knows that the brand will <em>not</em> suffer because of that decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The BFED will also suggest that links are styled as such, and with underlines, so that users can identify them within copy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"third-party-css-and-javascript-libraries-and-frameworks\">Third party CSS and Javascript libraries and frameworks</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The BFED will carefully select third party code based on the quality of the code itself by reviewing source code, <em>not</em> based on the popularity of said code. He/she favours reliability over popularity every time.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"ui-architecture\">UI architecture</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The BFED will adhere to the following quote:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>\u201cAs a Lead JavaScript Engineer, I try to get my team to write as little JavaScript as possible.\u201d\r\n<br/>\u2014 <cite>James Norton</cite></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, the BFED realises that <a href=\"http://adamsilver.io/articles/the-disadvantages-of-single-page-applications/\">Single Page Applications cause severe problems</a> and that by avoiding them and leaning on the server appropriately provides a better experience and reach.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"cv\">CV</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The BFED will develop a site based on the context of the problem and provide a solution accordingly. He/she will not just use [insert buzz word here] to improve his/her chances of finding another job based on the current technology fad in order to increase their day rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Be a great front-end developer. Be boring.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inspired by Cap Watkins' article, <a href=\"http://blog.capwatkins.com/the-boring-designer\">The Boring Designer</a>, thank you.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t    \r\n                </div>\r\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>", "url_domain": "thebfed.com", "slug": "2015-07-16-the-boring-front-end-developer-by-adam-silver", "title": "\u65e0\u804a\u3001\u4e4f\u5473\u7684\u524d\u7aef\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08", "url": "http://thebfed.com", "readable_title": "The Boring Front-end Developer", "created_at": 1437021141392, "summary": "\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c97\u4f4d\u7684\u4eba\u90fd\u80fd\u5199\u51fa\u8fd9\u79cd \"The boring XXX\u201d \u7684\u6587\u7ae0\uff0c\u5410\u69fd\u81ea\u5df1\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u5751\u3002", "content": "\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c97\u4f4d\u7684\u4eba\u90fd\u80fd\u5199\u51fa\u8fd9\u79cd \"The boring XXX\u201d \u7684\u6587\u7ae0\uff0c\u5410\u69fd\u81ea\u5df1\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u5751\u3002", "issue_id": 920}, {"picture": "", "tags": ["arch", "engineering", "experience", "startup"], "id": 1563, "readable_article": "<html><body><div><div class=\"body\">\r\n  \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n          <p><img src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/436/19516239409_a3d9bf8292_o.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"RIGHT\"/></p>\r\n<p>PlentyOfFish was acquired by the Match Group for $575 million in cash. And it all goes to Markus Frind. Here's the story of <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/how-markus-frind-bootstrapped-plentyoffish-and-sold-it-for-575-million-2015-7\">the acquisition</a>.\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>Way back in 2009 I wrote architecture article on PlentyOfFish, which I'll reproduce here for historical perspective. The main theme at that time was how Markus was making great fat stacks of cash from adsense by running this huge site all by himself on a Microsoft stack.</p>\r\n<p>We know the adsense goldmine played out long ago. What else has changed? We don't really know. Sometime ago we stopped getting updates on PlentyOfFish\u00a0architecture changes, so that's all we have.</p>\r\n<p>I doubt much remains the same however. Now 75 people work at PlentyOfFish, there are 90 million registered users, and a whopping 3.6 million active daily users, so something must be happening.</p>\r\n<p>Anyway, here's the old PlentyOfFish Architecture. It still makes for interesting reading. I'm just wondering, when you get done reading, is being sold for $575 Million\u00a0the ending you would expect?</p>\r\n<h2>PlentyOfFish Architecture</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Update 5</strong>: <a href=\"http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/12/27/plentyoffish-update-6-billion-pageviews-and-32-billion-image.html\">PlentyOfFish Update - 6 Billion Pageviews And 32 Billion Images A Month</a><br/><a href=\"http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/12/27/plentyoffish-update-6-billion-pageviews-and-32-billion-image.html\"/><strong>Update 4</strong>: <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001279.html\">Jeff Atwood</a> costs out Markus' scale up approach against a scale out approach and finds scale up wanting. The discussion in the comments is as interesting as the article. My guess is Markus doesn't want to rewrite his software to work across a scale out cluster so even if it's more expensive scale up works better for his needs. <br/><strong>Update 3</strong>: <a href=\"http://plentyoffish.wordpress.com/2009/06/14/upgrades-themes-date-night/\">POF now has 200 million images</a> and serves 10,000 images served per second. They'll be moving to a 250,000 IOPS RamSan to handle the load. Also upgraded to a core database machine with 512 GB of RAM, 32 CPU\u2019s, SQLServer  2008 and Windows 2008. <br/><strong>Update 2</strong>: This seems to be a <a href=\"http://www.peer1.com/aboutus/customer_stories_plentyoffish.php?autostart=1\">POF Peer1 love fest infomercial</a>. It's pretty content free, but the production values are high. Lots of quirky sounds and fish swimming on the screen.<br/><strong>Update</strong>: by Facebook standards Read/WriteWeb says POF is worth a cool <a href=\"http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/plentyoffish_one_billion.php\">one billion dollars</a>. It helps to talk like Dr. Evil when saying it out loud.<br/><br/>PlentyOfFish is a hugely popular on-line dating system slammed by over 45 million visitors a month and 30+ million hits a day (500 - 600 pages per second). But that's not the most interesting part of the story. All this is handled by one person, using a handful of servers, working a few hours a day, while making $6 million a year from Google ads. Jealous? I know I am. How are all these love connections made using so few resources?</p>\r\n<p>Site: http://www.plentyoffish.com/</p>\r\n<h2>Information Sources</h2>\r\n<li> <a href=\"http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=331501#331501\">Channel9 Interview with Markus Frind</a></li>\r\n<li> <a href=\"http://plentyoffish.wordpress.com\">Blog of Markus Frind</a></li>\r\n<li> <a href=\"http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/plentyoffish_one_billion.php\">Plentyoffish: 1-Man Company May Be Worth $1Billion</a><br/>\r\n<h2>The Platform</h2>\r\n</li>\r\n<li> Microsoft Windows</li>\r\n<li> ASP.NET</li>\r\n<li> IIS</li>\r\n<li> Akamai CDN</li>\r\n<li> Foundry ServerIron Load Balancer<br/>\r\n<h2>The Stats</h2>\r\n</li>\r\n<li> PlentyOfFish (POF) gets 1.2 billion page views/month, and 500,000 average unique logins per day. The peak season is January, when it will grow 30 percent.</li>\r\n<li> POF has one single employee: the founder and CEO  Markus Frind.</li>\r\n<li> Makes up to $10 million a year on Google ads working only two hours a day.</li>\r\n<li> 30+ Million Hits a Day (500 - 600 pages per second).</li>\r\n<li> 1.1 billion page views and 45 million visitors a month.</li>\r\n<li> Has 5-10 times the click through rate of Facebook.</li>\r\n<li> A top 30 site in the US based on Competes Attention metric,  top  10 in Canada and  top 30 in the UK.</li>\r\n<li> 2 load balanced web servers with 2 Quad Core Intel Xeon X5355 @ 2.66Ghz),  8 Gigs of RAM (using about 800 MBs), 2 hard drives,  runs  Windows x64  Server  2003. </li>\r\n<li> 3 DB servers. No data on their configuration.</li>\r\n<li> Approaching 64,000 simultaneous connections and 2 million page views per hour.</li>\r\n<li> Internet connection is a 1Gbps line of which 200Mbps is used. </li>\r\n<li> 1 TB/day serving 171 million images through Akamai.</li>\r\n<li> 6TB storage array to handle millions of full sized images being uploaded every month to the site.<br/>\r\n<h2>What's Inside</h2>\r\n</li>\r\n<li> Revenue model has been to use Google ads. Match.com, in comparison, generates $300 million a year, primarily from subscriptions. POF's revenue model is about to change so it can capture more revenue from all those users. The plan is to hire more employees, hire sales people, and sell ads directly instead of relying solely on AdSense.</li>\r\n<li> With 30 million page views a day you can make good money on advertising, even a 5 - 10 cents a CPM.</li>\r\n<li> Akamai is used to serve 100 million plus image requests a day.  If you have 8 images and each takes 100 msecs you are  talking a second load just for the images. So distributing the images makes sense.</li>\r\n<li> 10\u2019s of millions of image requests are served directly from their servers, but the majority of these images are less than 2KB and are mostly cached in RAM.</li>\r\n<li> Everything is dynamic. Nothing is static.</li>\r\n<li> All outbound Data is Gzipped at a cost of only 30% CPU usage. This implies a lot of processing power on those servers, but it really cuts bandwidth usage.</li>\r\n<li> No caching functionality in ASP.NET is used.  It is not used because as soon as the data is put in the cache it's already expired.</li>\r\n<li> No built in components from ASP are used.  Everything is written from scratch. Nothing is more complex than a simple if then and for loops. Keep it simple.</li>\r\n<li> Load balancing<br/>- IIS arbitrarily limits the total connections to 64,000 so a load balancer was added to handle the large number of simultaneous connections. Adding   a second IP address and then using a round robin DNS was considered, but the load balancer was considered more redundant and allowed easier swap in of more web servers.  And using ServerIron allowed advanced functionality like bot blocking and load balancing based on passed on cookies, session data, and IP data.<br/>- The Windows Network Load Balancing (NLB) feature was not used because it doesn't do sticky sessions. A way around this would be to store session state in a database or in a shared file system.<br/>- 8-12 NLB servers can be put in a farm  and there can be an unlimited number of farms. A DNS round-robin scheme can be used between farms. Such an architecture has been used to enable 70 front end web servers to support over 300,000 concurrent users. <br/>- NLB has an affinity option so a user always maps to a certain server, thus no external storage is used for session state and if the server fails the user loses their state and must relogin. If this state includes a shopping cart or other important data, this solution may be poor, but for a dating site it seems reasonable.<br/>- It was thought that the cost of storing and fetching session data in software was too expensive. Hardware load balancing is simpler. Just map users to specific servers and if a server fails have the user log in again.<br/>- The cost of a ServerIron was cheaper and simpler than using NLB. Many major sites use them for TCP connection pooling, automated bot detection, etc. ServerIron can do a lot more than load balancing and these features are attractive for the cost.</li>\r\n<li> Has a big problem picking an ad server. Ad server firms want several hundred thousand a year plus they want multi-year contracts. </li>\r\n<li> In the process of getting rid of ASP.NET repeaters and instead uses the append string thing or response.write. If you are doing over a million page views a day just write out the code to spit it out to the screen. </li>\r\n<li> Most of the build out costs went towards a SAN. Redundancy at any cost.</li>\r\n<li> Growth was through word of mouth. Went nuts in Canada, spread to UK, Australia, and then to the US.</li>\r\n<li> Database<br/>- One database is the main database.<br/>- Two databases are for search. Load balanced between search servers based on the type of search performed.<br/>- Monitors performance using task manager. When spikes show up he investigates.  Problems were usually blocking in the database. It's always database issues. Rarely any problems in .net. Because POF doesn't use the .net library it's relatively easy to track down performance problems. When you are using many layers of frameworks finding out where problems are hiding is frustrating and hard.<br/>- If you call the database 20 times per page view you are screwed no matter what you do.<br/>- Separate database reads from writes.  If you don't have a lot of RAM and you do reads and writes you get paging involved which can hang your system for seconds. <br/>- Try and make a read only database if you can.<br/>- Denormalize data. If you have to fetch stuff from 20 different tables try and make one table that is just used for reading.<br/>- One day it will work, but when your database doubles in size it won't work anymore.<br/>- If you only do one thing in a system it will do it really really well. Just do writes and that's good. Just do reads and that's good. Mix them up and it messes things up. You run into locking and blocking issues.<br/>- If you are maxing the CPU you've either done something wrong or it's really really optimized. If you can fit the database in RAM do it.</li>\r\n<li> The development process is: come up with an idea. Throw it up within 24 hours. It kind of half works. See what user response is by looking at what they actually do on the site. Do messages per user increase? Do session times increase? If people don't like it then take it down.</li>\r\n<li> System failures are rare and short lived. Biggest issues are DNS issues where some ISP says POF doesn't exist anymore. But because the site is free, people accept a little down time. People often don't notice sites down because they think it's their problem.</li>\r\n<li> Going from one million to 12 million users was a big jump. He could scale to 60 million users with two web servers.</li>\r\n<li> Will often look at competitors for ideas for new features.</li>\r\n<li> Will consider something like S3 when it becomes geographically load balanced.<br/>\r\n<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>\r\n</li>\r\n<li> You don't need millions in funding, a sprawling infrastructure, and a building full of employees to create a world class website that handles a torrent of users while making good money.  All you need is an idea that appeals to a lot of people, a site that takes off by word of mouth, and the experience and vision to build a site without falling into the typical traps of the trade. That's all  you need :-)</li>\r\n<li> Necessity is the mother of all change.</li>\r\n<li> When you grow quickly, but not too quickly you have a chance grow, modify, and adapt.</li>\r\n<li> RAM solves all problems. After that it's just growing using bigger machines.</li>\r\n<li> When starting out keep everything as simple as possible. Nearly everyone gives this same advice and Markus makes a noticeable point of saying everything he does is just obvious common sense. But clearly what is simple isn't merely common sense. Creating simple things is the result of years of practical experience.</li>\r\n<li> Keep database access fast and you have no issues.</li>\r\n<li> A big reason POF can get away with so few people and so little equipment is they use a CDN for serving large heavily used content. Using a CDN may be the secret sauce in a lot of large websites. Markus thinks there isn't a single site in the top 100 that doesn\u2019t use a CDN. Without a CDN he thinks load time in Australia would go to 3 or 4 seconds because of all the images. </li>\r\n<li> Advertising on Facebook yielded poor results. With 2000 clicks only 1 signed up. With a CTR of 0.04% Facebook gets 0.4 clicks per 1000 ad impressions, or .4 clicks per CPM. At 5 cent/CPM = 12.5 cents a click,  50 cent/CPM = $1.25 a click. $1.00/CPM = $2.50 a click. $15.00/CPM = $37.50 a click.</li>\r\n<li> It's easy to sell a few million page views at high CPM\u2019s. It's a LOT harder to sell billions of page views at high CPM\u2019s, as shown by Myspace and Facebook.</li>\r\n<li> The ad-supported model limits your revenues. You have to go to a paid model to grow larger. To generate 100 million a year as a free site is virtually impossible as you need too big a market.</li>\r\n<li> Growing page views via Facebook for a dating site won't work.  Having a visitor on you site is much more profitable.  Most of Facebook's page views are outside the US and you have to split 5 cent CPM\u2019s with Facebook.</li>\r\n<li> Co-req is a potential large source of income. This is where you offer in your site's sign up to send the user more information about mortgages are some other product.</li>\r\n<li> You can't always listen to user responses. Some users will always love new features and others will hate it.  Only a fraction will complain. Instead, look at what features people are actually using by watching your site.<br/>\r\n<h2>Related Articles</h2>\r\n</li>\r\n<li> <a

least\u00a02\u00a0to 3\u00a0months of every\u00a0year traveling, \u00a0and during this time\u00a0there where\u00a0insane scaling issues. \u00a0But somehow I still managed to create the largest dating site in the world without a single employee and travel the world!</p>\r\n<p>I constantly hear from people that the cheque i posted back in 2006 inspired them to start a company, \u00a0I hope that this will continue to inspire people and for people to see success is not instant, it does take a little while and when you have a extremely successful company this is what the month by month looks like in the early days.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0<br/>\r\nClick on the image to see the original adsense screen shot.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://plentyoffish.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/adsensepofearly.jpg\"><img

Over a year ago I did this, yet one month ago I started to get your weekly \u2018Matches\u2019 emails again, meaning you had kept my account open contrary to my wishes and that you\u2019d kept my personal details after I\u2019d told you to close my account which meant you should\u2019ve deleted them!! This means you\u2019ve also breached the DPA!</p>\r\n<p>Of course you have no contact details on your website so the only way I could try to find some way to contact your company after starting to get these emails again was to log back in again!  This was not my choice \u2013 you left me with no alternative because you don\u2019t believe in customer service as you don\u2019t have ANY such details on your webpage!  After logging in I discovered the above means to contact your company and I\u2019ve been doing so ever since.</p>\r\n<p>Your company has not even acknowledged me.  So I will set this out in plain English for you:</p>\r\n<p>You will close my account.<br/>\r\nYou will delete all details pertaining to me \u2013 EVERYTHING!<br/>\r\nYou will do so immediately.<br/>\r\nIf I do not get confirmation of this I will post this comment continuously.<br/>\r\nIf you do say you\u2019ve deleted it I\u2019ll be checking!!<br/>\r\nIf you fail to close my account and delete all my personal details immediately and continue to ignore me I will follow this through as a breach of the DPA and will be going back to my solicitor who has advised me thus far.<br/>\r\nI WILL ALSO GO TO THE PRESS ABOUT HOW YOU ILLEGALLY KEEP DETAILS OF CLOSED ACCOUNTS, REFUSE TO ANSWER YOUR CUSTOMERS AND CONTINUE TO PESTER THEM WITH EMAILS, HOLDING ON TO THEIR PERSONAL

He\u2019s the creator of Perl, a programming language that\u2019s widely regarded as the glue holding the internet together, and mocked by some as being a \u201cwrite-only\u201d language due to its density and liberal use of non-alphanumeric characters. Larry also has a background in linguistics, and is well known for delivering entertaining \u201cState of the Onion\u201d presentations about the future of Perl.</p>\r\n<p>At FOSDEM 2015 in Brussels, we caught up with Larry to ask him why Perl 6 has taken so long (Perl 5 was released in 1994), how difficult it is to manage a project when everyone has strong opinions and pulling in different directions, and how his background in linguistics influenced the design of Perl from the start. Get ready for some intriguing diversions\u2026</p>\r\n<p><span id=\"more-4072\"/></p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p/><center><img src=\"http://www.linuxvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wall1.jpg\"/></center>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p><strong>Linux Voice: You once had a plan to go and find an undocumented language somewhere in the world and create a written script for it, but you never had the opportunity to fulfil this plan. Is that something you\u2019d like to go back and do now?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Larry Wall: You have to be kind of young to be able to carry that off! It\u2019s actually a lot of hard work, and organisations that do these things don\u2019t tend to take people in when they\u2019re over a certain age. Partly this is down to health and vigour, but also because people are much better at picking up new languages when they\u2019re younger, and you have to learn the language before making a script for it.</p>\r\n<p>I started trying to teach myself Japanese about 10 years ago, and I could speak it quite well, because of my phonology and phonetics training \u2013 but it\u2019s very hard for me to understand what anybody says. So I can go to Japan and ask for directions, but I can\u2019t really understand the answers!</p>\r\n<blockquote><p><span class=\"bq\"><span class=\"section_colour\">\u201c</span>With Perl 6, we found<br/>\r\nsome ways to make<br/>\r\nthe computer more sure<br/>\r\nabout what the user is<br/>\r\ntalking about.<span class=\"section_colour\">\u201d</span></span></p></blockquote>\r\n<p>So usually learning a language well enough to develop a writing system, and to at least be conversational in the language, takes some period of years before you can get to the point where you can actually do literacy and start educating people on their own culture, as it were. And then you teach them to write about their own culture as well.</p>\r\n<p>Of course, if you have language helpers \u2013 and we were told not to call them \u201clanguage informants\u201d, or everyone would think we were working for the CIA! \u2013 if you have these people, you can get them to come in and help you learn the foreign language. They are not teachers but there are ways of eliciting things from someone who\u2019s not a language teacher \u2013 they can still teach you how to speak. They can take a stick and point to it and say \u201cthat\u2019s a stick\u201d, and drop it and say \u201cthe stick falls\u201d. Then you start writing things down and systematising things. </p>\r\n<p>The motivation that most people have, going out to these groups, is to translate the Bible into their languages. But that\u2019s only one part of it; the other is also culture preservation. Missionaries get kind of a bad rep on that, because anthropologists think they should be left to sit their in their own culture. But somebody is probably going to change their culture anyway \u2013 it\u2019s usually the army, or businesses coming in, like Coca Cola or the sewing machine people, or missionaries. And of those three, the missionaries are the least damaging, if they\u2019re doing their job right.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p><strong>LV: Many writing systems are based on existing scripts, and then you have invented ones like Greenlandic\u2026</strong></p>\r\n<p>LW: The Cherokee invented their own just by copying letters, and they have no mapping much to what we think of letters, and it\u2019s fairly arbitrary in that sense. It just has to represent how the people themselves think of the language, and sufficiently well to communicate. Often there will be variations on Western orthography, using characters from Latin where possible. Tonal languages have to mark the tones somehow, by accents or by numbers.</p>\r\n<p>As soon as you start leaning towards a phoenetic or phonological representation, then you also start to lose dialectical differences \u2013 or you have to write the dialectal differences. Or you have conventional spelling like we have in English, but pronunciation that doesn\u2019t really match it.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p><strong>LV: When you started working on Perl, what did you take from your background in linguistics that made you think: \u201cthis is really important in a programming language\u201d?</strong></p>\r\n<p>LW: I thought a lot about how people use languages. In real languages, you have a system of nouns and verbs and adjectives, and you kind of know which words are which type. And in real natural languages, you have a lot of instances of shoving one word into a different slot. The linguistic theory I studied was called tagmemics, and it accounts for how this works in a natural language \u2013 that you could have something that you think of as a noun, but you can verb it, and people do that all time.</p>\r\n<p>You can pretty much shove anything in any slot, and you can communicate. One of my favourite examples is shoving an entire sentence in as an adjective. The sentence goes like this: \u201cI don\u2019t like your I-can-use-anything-as-an-adjective attitude\u201d!</p>\r\n<p>So natural language is very flexible this way because you have a very intelligent listener \u2013 or at least, compared with a computer \u2013 who you can rely on to figure out what you must have meant, in case of ambiguity. Of course, in a computer language you have to manage the ambiguity much more closely.</p>\r\n<p>Arguably in Perl 1 through to 5 we didn\u2019t manage it quite adequately enough. Sometimes the computer was confused when it really shouldn\u2019t be. With Perl 6, we discovered some ways to make the computer more sure about what the user is talking about, even if the user is confused about whether something is really a string or a number. The computer knows the exact type of it. We figured out ways of having stronger typing internally but still have the allomorphic \u201cyou can use this as that\u201d idea.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p/><center><img src=\"http://www.linuxvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wall2.jpg\"/></center>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p><strong>LV: For a long time Perl was seen as the \u201cglue\u201d language of the internet, for fitting bits and pieces together. Do you see Perl 6 as a release to satisfy the needs of existing users, or as a way to bring in new people, and bring about a resurgence in the language?</strong></p>\r\n<p>LW: The initial intent was to make a better Perl for Perl programmers. But as we looked at the some of the inadequacies of Perl 5, it became apparent that if we fixed these inadequacies, Perl 6 would be more applicable, as I mentioned in my talk \u2013 like how J. R. R. Tolkien talked about applicability [see http://tinyurl.com/nhpr8g2].</p>\r\n<p>The idea that \u201ceasy things should be easy and hard things should be possible\u201d goes way back, to the boundary between Perl 2 and Perl 3. In Perl 2, we couldn\u2019t handle binary data or embedded nulls \u2013 it was just C-style strings. I said then that \u201cPerl is just a text processing language \u2013 you don\u2019t need those things in a text processing language\u201d.</p>\r\n<p>But it occurred to me at the time that there were a large number of problems that were mostly text, and had a little bit of binary data in them \u2013 network addresses and things like that. You use binary data to open the socket but then text to process it. So the applicability of the language more than doubled by making it possible to handle binary data.</p>\r\n<p>That began a trade-off about what things should be easy in a language. Nowadays we have a principle in Perl, and we stole the phrase Huffman coding for it, from the bit encoding system where you have different sizes for characters. Common characters are encoded in a fewer number of bits, and rarer characters are encoded in more bits.</p>\r\n<blockquote><p><span class=\"bq\"><span class=\"section_colour\">\u201c</span>There had to be a<br/>\r\nvery careful balancing<br/>\r\nact. There were just so<br/>\r\nmany good ideas at<br/>\r\nthe beginning.<span class=\"section_colour\">\u201d</span></span></p></blockquote>\r\n<p>We stole that idea as a general principle for Perl, for things that are commonly used, or when you have to type them very often \u2013 the common things need to be shorter or more succinct. Another bit of that, however, is that they\u2019re allowed to be more irregular. In natural language, it\u2019s actually the most commonly used verbs that tend to be the most irregular.</p>\r\n<p>And there\u2019s a reason for that, because you need more differentiation of them. One of my favourite books is called The Search for the Perfect Language by Umberto Eco, and it\u2019s not about computer languages; it\u2019s about philosophical languages, and the whole idea that maybe some ancient language was the perfect language and we should get back to it.</p>\r\n<p>All of those languages make the mistake of thinking that similar things should always be encoded similarly. But that\u2019s not how you communicate. If you have a bunch of barnyard animals, and they all have related names, and you say \u201cGo out and kill the Blerfoo\u201d, but you really wanted them to kill the Blerfee, you might get a cow killed when you want a chicken killed.</p>\r\n<p>So in realms like that it\u2019s actually better to differentiate the words, for more redundancy in the communication channel. The common words need to have more of that differentiation. It\u2019s all about communicating efficiently, and then there\u2019s also this idea of self-clocking codes. If you look at a UPC label on a product \u2013 a barcode \u2013 that\u2019s actually a self-clocking code where each pair of bars and spaces is always in a unit of seven columns wide. You rely on that \u2013 you know the width of the bars will always add up to that. So it\u2019s self-clocking.</p>\r\n<p>There are other self-clocking codes used in electronics. In the old transmission serial protocols there were stop and start bits so you could keep things synced up. Natural languages also do this. For instance, in the writing of Japanese, they don\u2019t use spaces. Because the way they write it, they will have a Kanji character from Chinese at the head of each phrase, and then the endings are written in the a syllabary.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p><strong>LV: Hiragana, right?</strong></p>\r\n<p>LW: Yes, Hiragana. So naturally the head of each phrase really stands out with this system. Similarly, in ancient Greek, most of the verbs were declined or conjugated. So they had standard endings were sort-of a clocking mechanism. Spaces were optional in their writing system as well \u2013 it was a more modern invention to put the spaces in.</p>\r\n<p>So similarly in computer languages, there\u2019s value in having a self-clocking code. We rely on this heavily in Perl, and even more heavily in Perl 6 than in previous releases. The idea that when you\u2019re parsing an expression, you\u2019re either expecting a term or an infix operator. When you\u2019re expecting a term you might also get a prefix operator \u2013 that\u2019s kind-of in the same expectation slot \u2013 and when you\u2019re expecting an infix you might also get a postfix for the previous term.</p>\r\n<p>But it flips back and forth. And if the compiler actually knows which it is expecting, you can overload those a little bit, and Perl does this. So a slash when it\u2019s expecting a term will introduce a regular expression, whereas a slash when you\u2019re expecting an infix will be division. On the other hand, we don\u2019t want to overload everything, because then you lose the self-clocking redundancy.</p>\r\n<p>Most of our best error messages, for syntax errors, actually come out of noticing that you have two terms in a row. And then we try to figure out why there are two terms in a row \u2013 \u201coh, you must have left a semicolon out on the previous line\u201d. So we can produce much better error messages than the more ad-hoc parsers.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p/><center><img src=\"http://www.linuxvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wall3.jpg\"/></center>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p><strong>LV: Why has Perl 6 taken fifteen years? It must be hard overseeing a language when everyone has different opinions about things, and there\u2019s not always the right way to do things, and the wrong way.</strong></p>\r\n<p>LW: There had to be a very careful balancing act. There were just so many good ideas at the beginning \u2013 well, I don\u2019t want to say they were all good ideas. There were so many pain points, like there were 361 RFCs [feature proposal documents] when I expected maybe 20. We had to sit back and actually look at them all, and ignore the proposed solutions, because they were all over the map and all had tunnel vision. Each one many have just changed one thing, but if we had done them all, it would\u2019ve been a complete mess.</p>\r\n<p>So we had to re-rationalise based on how people were actually hurting when they tried to use Perl 5. We started to look at the unifying, underlying ideas. Many of these RFCs were based on the fact that we had an inadequate type system. By introducing a more coherent type system we could fix many problems in a sane fashion and a cohesive fashion.</p>\r\n<p>And we started noticing other ways how we could unify the featuresets and start reusing ideas in different areas. Not necessarily that they were the same thing underneath. We have a standard way of writing pairs \u2013 well, two ways in Perl! But the way of writing pairs with a colon could also be reused for radix notation, or for literal numbers in any base. It could also be used for various alternative forms of quoting. We say in Perl that it\u2019s \u201cstrangely consistent\u201d.</p>\r\n<blockquote><p><span class=\"bq\"><span class=\"section_colour\">\u201c</span>People who made early<br/>\r\nimplementations of Perl 6<br/>\r\ncame back to me, cap in<br/>\r\nhand, and said \u201cWe really<br/>\r\nneed a language designer.\u201d<span class=\"section_colour\">\u201d</span></span></p></blockquote>\r\n<p>Similar ideas pop up, and you say \u201cI\u2019m already familiar with how that syntax works, but I see it\u2019s being used for something else\u201d. So it took some unity of vision to find these unifications. People who had the various ideas and made early implementations of Perl 6 came back to me, cap-in-hand, and said \u201cWe really need a language designer. Could you be our benevolent dictator?\u201d</p>\r\n<p>So I was the language designer, but I was almost explicitly told: \u201cStay out of the implementation! We saw what you did made out of Perl 5, and we don\u2019t like it!\u201d It was really funny because the innards of the new implementation started looking a whole lot like Perl 5 inside, and maybe that\u2019s why some of the early implementations didn\u2019t work well.</p>\r\n<p>Because we were still feeling our way into the whole design, the implementations made a lot of assumptions about what VM should do and shouldn\u2019t do, so we ended up with something like an object oriented assembly language. That sort of problem was fairly pervasive at the beginning. Then the Pugs guys came along and said \u201cLet\u2019s use Haskell, because it makes you think very clearly about what you\u2019re doing. Let\u2019s use it to clarify our semantic model underneath.\u201d</p>\r\n<p>So we nailed down some of those semantic models, but more importantly, we started building the test suite at that point, to be consistent with those semantic models. Then after that, the Parrot VM continued developing, and then another implementation, Niecza, came along and it was based on .NET. It was by a young fellow who was very smart and implemented a large subset of Perl 6, but he was kind of a loner, didn\u2019t really figure out a way to get other people involved in his project.</p>\r\n<p>At the same time the Parrot project was getting too big for anyone to really manage it inside, and very difficult to refactor. At that point the fellows working on Rakudo decided that we probably needed to be on more platforms than just the Parrot VM. So they invented a portability layer called NQP which stands for \u201cNot Quite Perl\u201d. They ported it to first of all run on the JVM (Java Virtual Machine), and while they were doing that they were also secretly working on a new VM called MoarVM. That became public a little over a year ago.</p>\r\n<p>Both MoarVM and JVM run a pretty much equivalent set of regression tests \u2013 Parrot is kind-of trailing back in some areas. So that has been very good to flush out VM-specific assumptions, and we\u2019re starting to think about NQP targeting other things. There was a Google Summer of Code project year to target NQP to JavaScript, and that might fit right in, because MoarVM also uses Node.js for much of its more mundane processing.</p>\r\n<p>We probably need to concentrate on MoarVM for the rest of this year, until we actually define 6.0, and then the rest will catch up.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p><strong>LV: Last year in the UK, the government kicked off the Year of Code, an attempt to get young people interested in programming. There are lots of opinions about how this should be done \u2013 like whether you should teach low-level languages at the start, so that people really understand memory usage, or a high-level language. What\u2019s your take on that?</strong></p>\r\n<p>LW: Up until now, the Python community has done a much better job of getting into the lower levels of education than we have. We\u2019d like to do something in that space too, and that\u2019s partly why we have the butterfly logo, because it\u2019s going to be appealing to seven year old girls!</p>\r\n<p>But we do think that Perl 6 will be learnable as a first language. A number of people have surprised us by learning Perl 5 as their first language. And you know, there are a number of fairly powerful concepts even in Perl 5, like closures, lexical scoping, and features you generally get from functional programming. Even more so in Perl 6.</p>\r\n<blockquote><p><span class=\"bq\"><span class=\"section_colour\">\u201c</span>Until now, the Python<br/>\r\ncommunity has done a<br/>\r\nmuch better job of<br/>\r\ngetting into the lower<br/>\r\nlevels of education.<span class=\"section_colour\">\u201d</span></span></p></blockquote>\r\n<p>Part of the reason the Perl 6 has taken so long is that we have around 50 different principles we try to stick to, and in language design you\u2019re end up juggling everything and saying \u201cwhat\u2019s really the most important principle here\u201d? There has been a lot of discussion about a lot of different things. Sometimes we commit to a decision, work with it for a while, and then realise it wasn\u2019t quite the right decision.</p>\r\n<p>We didn\u2019t design or specify pretty much anything about concurrent programming until someone came along who was smart enough about it and knew what the different trade-offs were, and that\u2019s Jonathan Worthington.

Composability is important in the rest of the language.</p>\r\n<p>There are an awful lot of concurrent and parallel programming systems that don\u2019t compose well \u2013 like threads and locks, and there have been lots of ways to do it poorly. So in one sense, it\u2019s been worth waiting this extra time to see some of these languages like Go and C# develop really good high-level primitives \u2013 that\u2019s sort of a contradiction in terms \u2013 that compose well.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div></body></html>", "url_domain": "www.linuxvoice.com", "slug": "2015-07-16-interview-larry-wall", "title": "\u91c7\u8bbf Perl \u4e4b\u7236 Larry Wall", "url": "http://www.linuxvoice.com/interview-larry-wall/", "readable_title": "Interview: Larry Wall", "created_at": 1437011017421, "summary": "Perl 5\u662f94\u5e74\u53d1\u5e03\u7684\uff1bPerl 6\u5c06\u5728\u4eca\u5e74\u5e74\u5e95\u53d1\u5e03\u3002\u6bd4HTML4\u5230HTML5\u7684\u8def\u8fd8\u957f\u3002\u4e3a\u4f55Perl 6\u8981\u7b49\u90a3\u4e48\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\uff1f", "content": "<p>Perl 5\u662f1994\u5e74\u53d1\u5e03\u7684\uff1bPerl 6\u5c06\u5728\u4eca\u5e74\u5e74\u5e95\u53d1\u5e03\u3002\u6bd4HTML4\u5347\u7ea7\u5230HTML5\u7684\u8def\u8fd8\u957f\u3002\u4e3a\u4f55Perl 6\u8981\u7b49\u90a3\u4e48\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\uff1fPerl\u662fWeb 1.0\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u5199\u7f51\u7ad9\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u3002\u90a3\u65f6\u5019\u5f88\u591a\u7f51\u7ad9\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5957\u8def\uff1aPerl CGI \u505a\u7684\u53d1\u5e03\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u5806\u9759\u6001\u9875\u9762\u3002</p>", "issue_id": 920}, {"picture": "", "tags": ["company", "coo", "startup"], "id": 1557, "readable_article": "<html><body><div><div class=\"section-inner layoutSingleColumn\"><h2 name=\"06a3\" id=\"06a3\" class=\"graf--h2 graf--first\">What Does a Startup COO Actually Do?</h2><p name=\"4cef\" id=\"4cef\" class=\"graf--p graf--empty\"><br/></p><p name=\"a4b4\" id=\"a4b4\" class=\"graf--p\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">In this post I explore the ambiguity of the role of a COO (Chief Operating Officer) in a startup, and my journey to becoming one at Mattermark.

One of our investors offered a third option, \u201cVP of Shit.\u201d I decided to go with COO.</p><h4 name=\"bc2c\" id=\"bc2c\" class=\"graf--h4\">The Future</h4><p name=\"35e0\" id=\"35e0\" class=\"graf--p graf--empty\"><br/></p><p name=\"fa13\" id=\"fa13\" class=\"graf--p\">In 2015, we hired an outstanding Customer Success Manager, Manali Karmarkar. That team is running like greased lightning now. We moved away from a centralized recruiting function with internal recruiters to a model that distributes the load amongst hiring managers. Finally, we hired a VP of Finance, Emad Khan, to take over finance, HR, and facilities.</p><p name=\"0764\" id=\"0764\" class=\"graf--p\">Keith Rabois says \u201cyou\u2019re constantly fixing things,\u201d which you are.
