With each announcement, both companies seem to be reaffirming their larger company goals and values \u2014 Apple asserting its commitment to designing and selling quality products, and Google bolstering its mission to collect and organize the world\u2019s data with the ultimate intent of monetizing the results with advertising.</p>\r\n<p>These goals resurface through many of the company\u2019s business decisions, most recently through the divergent app indexing frameworks promoted by the two companies. For a long time, deep app content has been locked in app code, largely un-indexed and inaccessible to search engine crawlers. The only content that crawlers could get was app titles and descriptions from the various app stores, and from company websites.</p>\r\n<p>Now that both Apple and Google have announced methods for indexing deep content within apps, the situation has dramatically and irreversibly changed. For those interested in the most cutting-edge digital marketing strategies, the concept of SEO will have to expand to include optimization of deep app content for inclusion in the Apple and Google indexes.</p>\r\n<p>Apple\u2019s overall focus on \u201cproducts\u201d positions the company to gain the most from a primarily app-based world. In Apple\u2019s ideal scenario, the web is only used as an invisible layer that links apps together and allows apps to become their own uniquely-controlled display-layers for private and public content.</p>\r\n<p>Conversely, Google stands to gain the most from a web-based world where data can be most easily collected, organized, and distributed so Google can become the presentation layer of the Internet. While apps are part of their data collection strategy, Google has invested heavily in <a href=\"https://www.google.com/webdesigner/\" target=\"_blank\">programs</a> that allow developers to create HTML5 web content to rival apps and thus return users to a web-based ecosystem.</p>\r\n<p>This article is the first in a three-part series about new strategies and opportunities for\u00a0app indexing in\u00a0Apple, Google, and other ecosystems.</p>\r\n<p>This first article focuses on the ways in which Apple\u2019s new Search API for <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/releasenotes/General/WhatsNewIniOS/Articles/iOS9.html\" target=\"_blank\">iOS 9</a> encourages and incentivizes an app-centric digital ecosystem and what that means for marketers looking to surface deep app content for Apple users. This is a comprehensive guide of what you as an SEO need to know about Apple\u2019s foray into search engineering, what it means for your company\u2019s app strategy, how it impacts your company\u2019s SEO strategy, and how to take advantage of these new opportunities to surface your company\u2019s app and website in Apple Search.</p>\r\n<p>The subsequent articles in the series will focus on Google\u2019s app indexing opportunities and the associated strategies, and on future app indexing challenges we will face with the growth wearables and other non-standard device apps and device indexes.</p>\r\n<h2>What Is Apple Search &amp; Why Does It Matter For SEO?</h2>\r\n<p>If you want to surface your app content for iOS users, Apple Search could become a key part of your SEO strategy. Like Google, Apple Search relies on an index (or more accurately, multiple indices) to organize the set of app screens that can be ranked in a search result. Apple refers to their indexes and the software that interfaces with those indexes collectively as \u201cApple Search.\u201d</p>\r\n<p>Indexed app screens can be surfaced by executing a search in Spotlight or Siri, or through a Spotlight Suggest result that appears when a user types in a query in the address bar of Safari\u00a0(before hitting \u201center\u201d). This means that a user can start a search on Safari and end up being directed to a deep link <em>without ever seeing a single Google result</em>\u00a0\u2014 even where Google is the \u201cdefault\u201d search engine.</p>\r\n<p>To accomplish this, Apple has introduced the concept of public and private indexing, and three methods for iOS developers to get their app screens indexed for Apple Search: NSUserActivity, CoreSpotlight, and Web Markup.</p>\r\n<p>Despite being limited to iOS app indexing (sorry Android buddies, your apps can\u2019t play here), Apple\u2019s new Search and indexing framework will be an important traffic channel, especially for Apple users who sometimes bypass Google\u2019s algorithms entirely. Unlike Google, Apple has come up with two indexing methods that <em>do not</em> require corresponding web pages to drive app indexing:</p>\r\n<h3><strong>1. NSUserActivity Indexing</strong></h3>\r\n<p>In this indexing method, Apple indexes \u201cuser activities,\u201d which you can think of as a sort of \u201cbookmark + JsessionID + cookie\u201d\u00a0snapshot of a app screen, complete with the navigational understanding of how a user got there and how they have interacted with that screen in the past. Apple calls these snapshots \u201cNSUserActivities,\u201d and they can be indexed by Apple when a developer adds search eligibility markup to the app\u2019s code itself (no website needed), and a user accesses a screen with the markup.</p>\r\n<p>Each NSUserActivity can also be associated with a contentAttributeSet which includes relevant meta data like titles, keywords, and descriptions. This information is used to create the appearance of the search result and to help determine rankings. Each NSUserActivity should have a uniqueIdentifier and/or include a\u00a0URL link to its corresponding web content.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>2. CoreSpotlight Indexing</strong></h3>\r\n<p>The CoreSpotlight API has historically allowed native iOS components like the Calendar and Mail apps to include items in Spotlight search results. This is now being opened up to all apps in the App Store. This indexing method is somewhat analogous to submitting an XML sitemap in SEO, but the index file is submitted with your application manifest, and it is a different, iOS-specific code, created in a file called a \u201c<span>CSSearchableIndex</span>.\u201d</p>\r\n<p>In this indexing method, the app screens to be indexed are called \u201c<span>CSSearchableItem</span>(s),\u201d and each one is associated with a label called a \u201c<span>uniqueIdentifier</span>.\u201d Each <span>CSSearchableItem</span>\u00a0can be associated with a \u201c<span>CSSerchableItemAttributeSet</span>\u201d that includes relevant metadata like titles, keywords and descriptions. The <span>CSSerchableItemAttributeSet</span>\u00a0is used to determine algorithmic relevance and populate the search result.</p>\r\n<p>Each <span>CSSearchableItem</span>/<span>uniqueIdentifier</span>\u00a0combo can also be associated with \u201c<span>domainIdentifier</span>\u201d to help group certain types of app screens in the database, so that they can be added or removed from the <span>CSSearchableIndex</span>\u00a0as a group. For example, a <span>uniqueIdentifier</span>\u00a0might be associated with a specific photo screen while a <span>domainIdentifier</span>\u00a0might indicate all of the photos within an album.</p>\r\n<p>The important thing to note is that NSUserActivity and CoreSpotlight source their search result meta data <em>from code within the apps themselves</em> (not from a website). This means that SEOs need to be more involved in the app development process earlier than ever before in order to ensure that Apple Search optimized title, description, and keyword markup is included in the app at launch (just like you would for a new web page launch back in 1999).</p>\r\n<p>In addition to NSUserActivity and CoreSpotlight, Apple also allows you to get your deep app content indexed using a web crawler and deep link markup, similar to Google. Deep linking is a process in which web markup is used to link web URLs to their corresponding app screens\u00a0(called URIs), so that a crawler can understand the connection between the URLs and the URIs. This option <em>does</em> require app content to have crawlable corresponding web content:</p>\r\n<h3><strong>3. Web Markup Indexing</strong></h3>\r\n<p>In this indexing method, Apple\u2019s new web-crawler, \u201cApplebot,\u201d indexes app content from the marketing and/or support URLs that are submitted with the app manifest. Applebot can crawl your website and index corresponding app screens based on the following markup protocols:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://dev.twitter.com/cards/mobile/deep-linking\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter Card Markup</a>: Twitter Card markup can include a protocol to reference deep links to app screens.</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://applinks.org/documentation/\">App Links Protocol</a>: App Links is an external deep linking standard that is also used by Facebook and Bing (and works on iOS and Android).</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/PromotingAppswithAppBanners/PromotingAppswithAppBanners.html\">Apple\u2019s Smart App Banners</a>: A protocol created by Apple that displays a special Apple banner on websites when they are accessed from iOS devices. The banner either prompts the user to open the app (if installed) or download it from the App Store.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Additionally, though it won\u2019t help you get new app screens indexed, Applebot can crawl two other protocols, looking for metadata to display in search results:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://ogp.me/\">Open Graph</a>: Facebook\u2019s protocol that makes web content easier to share. Apple supports the full protocol and if OG tagging is already in place, Applebot can crawl it.</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://Schema.org\" target=\"_blank\">Schema.org</a>: An external markup standard widely embraced across the web. Apple Search is launching with limited support, including the following schemas: AggregateRating, Offers, PriceRange, Interaction Count (likes, views, comments), Organization (phone numbers), Recipes, SearchAction (landing page for search), ImageObject and Actions, limited to: dialing a phone number, getting directions, playing audio or video file.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Web Markup is great for SEOs, because SEOs can enable and control indexing and metadata by adding markup to the website as we are used to doing. iOS app developers need only generate and share the URI deep links with the SEO team. If app URIs are already in place, this can be a very fast and simple implementation that doesn\u2019t require any development resources or an app update.</p>\r\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT REMINDER:</strong> When iOS deep links on a web page are clicked (be it from your web page or even Facebook or Twitter), they initiate an \u201c<span>openURL</span>\u201d command that tells the phone Operating System to switch from the browser to an app\u00a0\u2014\u00a0<span>openURL</span>\u00a0<em>must</em> be enabled in your app code for deep links to open in the app.</p>\r\n<p>Make sure your app can actually open deep links before you include them in your web markup. If you are relying exclusively on the Web Markup method for app indexing, you will still need to make this change to your app and submit the update. It\u2019s a small detail, but an important one.</p>\r\n<h2>How Does Apple Rank\u00a0Apps In Apple Search?</h2>\r\n<p>In light of an increased global sensitivity to privacy issues (think the \u201c<a href=\"http://searchengineland.com/library/legal/legal-right-to-be-forgotten\">Right to Be Forgotten</a>\u201d in the EU), Apple has begun to focus on privacy concerns as a key differentiator, and selling point for their products and services. Apple\u2019s new app indexing framework showcases a distinct effort to protect users\u2019 personal information by introducing multiple app indexes:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A private \u2018Device Index,\u2019 which is a personal index that is only accessible by the specific user ID, like a small individualized database for each Apple user</li>\r\n<li>A public \u2018Cloud Index,\u2019 which holds content that is accessible from any Apple device through Spotlight, Siri, or Spotlight Suggest in Safari</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Because of this architecture, developers can (and should) allow a user\u2019s private app screens to be saved to a private Device Index. Private screens in any app, such as direct messages and user dashboards, are now theoretically indexable.</p>\r\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> A similar personalized search history is used by Google, but has never been publicly described as a separate \u201cindex\u201d or opened up for developer access. Google tested offering \u2018desktop search\u2019 years ago, and has recently been experimenting with indexing personal email results from Gmail. We expect this trend to continue and expand for both Google and Apple into the future.</p>\r\n<p>Like Google, Apple has not disclosed the exact details of their search algorithm, but they have described some key ranking factors that should be considered. Many of Apple\u2019s search ranking factors focus on determining how content should rank in a private Device Index vs. the public Cloud Index. SEOs need to be measured and responsible to have a positive impact on rankings because Apple has said that \u201cmalicious or poorly considered [app indexing strategy] <em>implementations</em>\u201d will be penalized \u201c<em>or suppressed entirely</em>\u201d (put those black hats away).</p>\r\n<p>A more comprehensive list of Apple Search ranking factors is included below:</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Positive Ranking Factors</strong></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>App Installation Status.</strong>\u00a0Is the app is installed on the device? (installed apps seem to get preference)</li>\r\n<li><strong>Personalized App Engagement.</strong>\u00a0Does the individual engage with the screen in the app? This is based on time spent with result that Apple determines from session analytics.</li>\r\n<li><strong>App Result Click-Through Rate.</strong>\u00a0Do users frequently click through the search result vs. picking another result or searching again?</li>\r\n<li><strong>Keywords/ Title.</strong>\u00a0Do keywords from the \u201ckeywords\u201d and \u201ctitle\u201d designations in the app markup match up with the user\u2019s query?</li>\r\n<li><strong>Aggregated Engagement.</strong>\u00a0How <em>many</em> users engage with the app screen?</li>\r\n<li><strong>Structured Data on Web.</strong>\u00a0Is structured data correctly implemented?</li>\r\n<li><strong>Canonical App IDs.</strong>\u00a0Is the same screen associated with one unique ID or URL across multiple indexing methods (NSUserActivity, CoreSpotlight, and Web Markup)?</li>\r\n<li><strong>Strength/Popularity of Web URL.</strong>\u00a0How popular is the website associated with the app deep links? (Presumably, this is based on Applebot\u2019s crawl.)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3><strong>Negative Ranking Factors</strong></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Low Engagement.</strong>\u00a0Do very few users engage with the app screen? (engagement determined by session analytics)</li>\r\n<li><strong>Over-Indexing.</strong>\u00a0Does the app have many screens in the index with low or no engagement?</li>\r\n<li><strong>Returns.</strong>\u00a0Do users return to search results right after looking at the app?</li>\r\n<li><strong>Keywords Spamming.</strong>\u00a0Are developers stuffing too many irrelevant keywords into the keyword field?</li>\r\n<li><strong>Interstitials.</strong>\u00a0Is something covering the content in the app or preventing users from accessing it?</li>\r\n<li><strong>Javascript (web only).</strong>\u00a0Is Javascript preventing Applebot from crawling your site to find new app deep links?</li>\r\n<li><strong>Low Star Ratings, Low Review Volume, Poor Reviews.</strong>\u00a0Apple has not explicitly called these negative ranking factors for Apple Search, but they are negative ranking factors for the App Store, so we expect Apple to treat them similarly here.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Apple recommends pursuing multiple indexing methods to optimize app visibility, but the overlapping methods will inevitably create duplication across the various indexes. For example, private content could have both a NSUserActivity and CSSearchableItem indexed, and public content could have both a NSUserActivity and a Web Markup deep link indexed.</p>\r\n<p>This is obviously <em>not</em>\u00a0ideal for controlling Applebot\u2019s efficiency, so Apple <em>strongly</em>\u00a0recommends associating each NSUserActivity, CSSearchableItem, and Web Markup deep link with the same uniqueIdentifier and/or URL. This is Applebot\u2019s version of a canonical, and it\u2019s so important to Apple that they\u2019ve even made it a ranking factor in the Apple Search algorithm.</p>\r\n<h2>How Do I Decide Which Indexing Option Is Most Strategic For My Company?</h2>\r\n<p>iOS developers can indicate which indexes they think their app content should be included in. Not all app content must be indexed, so the first question your company needs to answer is: Which content should be included in Apples index and which should not?</p>\r\n<p>Then, since not all indexing methods can assign content to both the public and private indexes, ask: Of the content that should be indexed, which content should be publicly accessible, and which content should be private? The answers to these questions will be the beginning of your app indexing plan.</p>\r\n<p>Generating a list of all app screens and their associated NSUserActivities, then mapping out the public or private nature of the content is an organized way to document this process. Once the private or public nature of app content is determined, the appropriate indexing method can be selected to meet those needs. The NSUserActivities and/or the CoreSpotlight indexing methods can both be used to index content that is intended for the private Device Index while NSUserActivities and or Web Markup can both be used to index content that is intended for the public Cloud Index.</p>\r\n<p>SEOs who are used to Google\u2019s somewhat straightforward and open standards for indexing may have a hard time understanding the 3 different ways that app content can be added to Apple\u2019s Search indexes and how those methods interact.</p>\r\n<p>We created the chart below to help \u2014\u00a0it outlines the basic functions and limitations for each Apple Search indexing method, described in the previous section, so that the comparison becomes clearer:</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-223889\" src=\"http://searchengineland.com/figz/wp-content/seloads/2015/06/iOS-9-Apple-Search-Indexing-Methods-800x553-800x553.png\" alt=\"iOS-9-Apple-Search-Indexing-Methods-800x553\" width=\"800\" height=\"553\"/></p>\r\n<p><img class=\"has-border aligncenter wp-image-224402 size-full\" src=\"http://searchengineland.com/figz/wp-content/seloads/2015/07/How-Apple-Search-Works.png\" alt=\"How-Apple-Search-Works\" width=\"442\" height=\"798\"/></p>\r\n<p>NSUserActivity is the only indexing method that has the capability to privately <em>and</em> publicly index content. Engagement statistics from the NSUserActivity session analytics are part of the ranking algorithm, so Apple recommends focusing on the NSUserActivity indexing method first.</p>\r\n<p>Developers can indicate whether a NSUserActivity\u00a0should be privately or publicly indexed. However, Apple doesn\u2019t automatically publicly index NSUserActivities that are marked for public indexing. Apple still indexes the NSUserActivity to the private Device Index first, and later \u201cpromotes\u201d it to the public Cloud Index once a certain number of people have accessed it.</p>\r\n<p>One of the most unique aspects of this new framework is when and how specific NSUserActivities can be promoted to the Cloud Index. Apple\u2019s representative didn\u2019t get into the details, so this aspect of the framework may be a bit unclear until launch. Luckily, he did share a diagram that seemed to indicate that each screen within an app can have a variety of NSUserActivities, some privately indexable and some publically indexable. The developer must associate each indexable NSUserActivity with eligibility code: \u201c<span>var eligibleForSearch</span>\u201d (private indexing) and \u201c<span>var eligibleForSearch</span>\u201d + \u201c<span>var eligibleForPublicIndexing</span>\u201d (public indexing).</p>\r\n<p>In most cases, something like a user dashboard screen will have a publicly indexable default NSUserActivity \u2014 an ideal public search result for anyone who has never accessed this screen before. User-specific NSUserActivities that represent the non-default status of the screen should only be privately indexable because they are only appropriate for the specific user that triggered them.</p>\r\n<p>Since both default and customized NSUserActivities are associated with the same app screen, anyone who accesses the screen (public and private) generates engagement data to benefit the publicly indexable, default version of the screen. As a result, the default public version of the screen is a stronger candidate for promotion to the public Cloud Index. Furthermore, because engagement metrics are a positive ranking factor, the default public version of the screen will also\u00a0likely rank better in all searches, regardless of the user\u2019s historical interactions with the app.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-223890\" src=\"http://searchengineland.com/figz/wp-content/seloads/2015/06/NSUserActivity-Promoted-to-Cloud-Index.png\" alt=\"NSUserActivity-Promoted-to-Cloud-Index\" width=\"774\" height=\"708\"/></p>\r\n<h2>How\u00a0Can The Different Apple App Indexing Protocols Be Used Together To Benefit SEO?</h2>\r\n<p>Developers can use the NSUserActivity indexing method alone, but following the Web Markup indexing method in addition to the NSUserActivity indexing method has some <em>significant</em> advantages (that Apple can\u2019t infer from NSUserActivity alone):</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>When Web Markup is in place, deep linked app screens are <em>automatically </em>added to the public Cloud Index. (No waiting for a certain number of users to discover your content before you can cross the Apple NSUserActivity promotion \u201cthreshold.\u201d)</li>\r\n<li>When Applebot finds appropriate Web Markup on your site, the web pages can also be added to Apple\u2019s index. A web page may rank in Spotlight Search, instead of the app, if the app is not installed. (<strong>Note:</strong> This means the Web Markup indexing method gives you two chances to rank: app and web. This is a huge competitive advantage because <em>Apple only indexes web pages that have been submitted to iTunes connect or web pages that contain this app deep link markup</em>. Applebot isn\u2019t a roaming crawler like Googlebot.)</li>\r\n<li>\u201cWebsite Popularity\u201d helps increase your app\u2019s \u201cRelevance Score\u201d in Apple Search, which is a central aspect of the Apple search algorithm.</li>\r\n<li>Structured data from the website is an independent ranking factor in the Apple Search algorithm.</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://schema.org/docs/actions.html\" target=\"_blank\">Action Schema</a> from your website can be pulled in to give your app\u2019s search result additional visual elements (#pizzaz) that make it more appealing to users and drive click-through from the search result, another Apple Search ranking factor.</li>\r\n<li><strong>BONUS POINTS:</strong> This gets you halfway to getting your deep links indexed in Google Search as well (this will be discussed at length in the next article in this series).</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<div id=\"attachment_223892\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-223892\" src=\"http://searchengineland.com/figz/wp-content/seloads/2015/06/eventbrite-ad-apple.png\" alt=\"Source: https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2015/?id=709\" width=\"611\" height=\"890\"/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2015/?id=709</p></div>\r\n<p>Deep links and user activities \u2014\u00a0whether private or\u00a0public \u2014\u00a0only show up as results when the app is installed on the user\u2019s device (or has been in the past). When the app is <em>not</em>\u00a0installed on a user\u2019s device, Apple will show either an App Store result or indexed web content (discovered by Applebot crawling a site\u2019s Web Markup).</p>\r\n<p>When a user gets the website result, Apple is counting on web developers to have implemented Smart App Banners to refer users from the website to the app download page in the App Store. Apple\u2019s Smart App Banners\u00a0are great for driving downloads from web traffic that approaches the website from\u00a0a traditional web referral;\u00a0but if Apple Search\u2019s ultimate goal is to navigate people away from websites and into an app-only digital space, this strategy misses the boat.</p>\r\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong>\u00a0This is a notably less direct experience when contrasted with Google. A user without the app installed who taps a Google deep link from a Google search result is immediately delivered to the app download page in Google Play or the iOS App Store.</p>\r\n<p>Apple has previously tested sending these clicks directly to the App Store, but received pushback from users who wanted a website option. While the new solution\u00a0satisfies\u00a0those users, it may\u00a0fail to convert as many\u00a0searches into app downloads. It\u2019s especially tenuous if users don\u2019t feel compelled to tap on the Smart App Banner or (more likely) if web developers have not enabled the Smart App Banner on their website at all.</p>\r\n<h2>Concluding Remarks</h2>\r\n<p>SEO practitioners must evolve to keep up with the expanding definition of what constitutes \u201cSEO.\u201d With the new iOS 9 app indexing announcement, SEOs also must evolve to work with Apple\u2019s new understanding of search engineering.</p>\r\n<p>Apple now offers deep app indexing that is significantly different from the app indexing opportunities provided by Google. This is largely due to its public and private indexing frameworks and the methods that marketers can use to get their deep app content indexed.</p>\r\n<p>Apple\u2019s ability to mine iOS user engagement metrics allows them to make engagement a central part of the ranking algorithm, putting less emphasis on traditional ranking factors like titles and descriptions. This is a notable evolution from how Apple currently handles search in the iOS App Store, which relies heavily on titles and keywords to determine app ranking.</p>\r\n<p>The growing opportunity to target more keywords with deep app content should create incentive for app developers to focus slightly more on marketing at earlier stages in app development and force a more strategic and ongoing partnership between SEOs and app developers.</p>\r\n<p>In all the discussion of the new Apple Search and app indexing, the big question that some say has not been adequately addressed is about search volume and tracking. It is unclear how much total search volume and engagement the new Apple Search utilities will get, especially when compared to Google search (and Google\u2019s new ability to <a href=\"http://searchengineland.com/google-brings-app-indexing-support-to-ios-apps-221708\">surface iOS app deep links</a> in their search results).</p>\r\n<p>Will users be drawn to app deep links over traditional web content, or will they even know the difference? Will users begin to prefer a Spotlight Search to find new apps and app content? Will they still prefer App Store searches, or will the lines between Apple search utilities continue to blur, leading to a single,\u00a0app-centric Spotlight-Safari-Siri dashboard interface that can fast track app total domination over the web?</p>\r\n<p>For some companies whose apps lack website parity and others whose apps have extensive private or personalized content, Apple Search currently represents the <em>only</em> opportunity to get their app content indexed, but the overall impact of Apple Search remains to seen.</p>\r\n<p>While Apple Search presents many opportunities for new exposure on Apple devices,\u00a0developers will have to work within Apple\u2019s new app indexing framework, and optimize for a variety of indexes, using new proprietary Apple methods. Success will be limited by the volume of search that Apple Search outlets can carve out from their loyal audience, and the impact of search optimization initiatives will be much more challenging to measure.</p>\r\n<p>Since Apple\u2019s push for privacy is something Google won\u2019t match (at least, not yet, and not without completely changing the company\u2019s data-collection practices), we expect Apple to make more key investments in privacy-focused features. Remember, Apple\u2019s business model is based on turning a profit on their own products, not based on helping marketers turn a profit on\u00a0theirs. If Apple believes users will pay more for privacy (or the illusion of privacy), they will have no problem restricting data from marketers.</p>\r\n<p>Conversely, if Apple believes they can turn more of a profit by selling access to Apple Search data, we may see new products targeted at marketers in the future \u2014 for a price. (Remember how expensive those iAds were?) Apple has historically been late to provide even basic analytics to marketers, so\u00a0Apple Search\u00a0could provide\u00a0little to no access over many of the metrics we already enjoy in Google\u00a0Analytics.</p>\r\n<p>While we appreciate Apple\u2019s <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2015/?id=709\" target=\"_blank\">video explanation</a> of what they\u2019re doing with Apple Search and the amount of time they are giving SEOs and developers to prepare for these changes, many questions about the technology remain unanswered. We are left wondering: Does Apple plan to use some version of QDF to determine NSUserActivity promotion into the public Cloud Index?</p>\r\n<p>In other words, will a sudden increase of people engaging with a publicly indexable NSUserActivity (like a Bruins game in the NHL app) cause the activity to get promoted to the public Cloud Index before activities with more total views but less recent traffic (such as a Bruins team roster screen)? Will the fresher activity rank higher because of its timeliness? Conversely, when people stop engaging with fresh user activities, will they get \u201cdemoted\u201d back down to the private Device Index (or, say, replaced with a more recent Bruins game)?</p>\r\n<p>What questions do you have?

			"readable_article": "<html><body><div><div class=\"section-inner layoutSingleColumn\"><p name=\"de58\" id=\"de58\" class=\"graf--p graf--first\">In my opinion, while most of the media focus on this week\u2019s product launch was around iPhone6 or the potential of AppleWatch, the real long term opportunity is in ApplePay. In one fell swoop, I think Apple has now positioned itself to completely disrupt the US (and potentially international) banking infrastructure in the next 10\u201320 years and make many trillion (yes, trillion) dollars of incremental revenue doing it. Here\u2019s how:</p><h3 name=\"61f0\" id=\"61f0\" class=\"graf--h3\">Step 1:</h3><h4 name=\"1859\" id=\"1859\" class=\"graf--h4\">Co-opt the existing infrastructure</h4><p name=\"ec2f\" id=\"ec2f\" class=\"graf--p graf--empty\"><br/></p><p name=\"3d91\" id=\"3d91\" class=\"graf--p\">By working with Visa/MC/Amex, Apple has replayed its masterstroke with the music labels that seeded their iPod and eventual iPhone business lines. Apple has convinced these major entities to support a system that today will enable more seamless payments, validate existing rails and continue to allow Visa/MC/Amex to validate their existence to issuing banks. But over time, what they\u2019ve really done is co-opt these companies in a way that will render issuing banks as just a set of merchant acquirers\u200a\u2014\u200awhich probably isn\u2019t a business that can create the margins that banks would need to support their current overhead.</p><h3 name=\"a3ff\" id=\"a3ff\" class=\"graf--h3\">Step 2:</h3><h4 name=\"8d98\" id=\"8d98\" class=\"graf--h4\">Get broad deployment of terminals</h4><p name=\"1072\" id=\"1072\" class=\"graf--p graf--empty\"><br/></p><p name=\"628b\" id=\"628b\" class=\"graf--p\">Because of their support for the existing infrastructure, they eliminate the barriers that could prevent 3rd parties, VARs, etc from pushing the adoption of the payment terminals needed to support Apple Pay.</p><h3 name=\"b6c4\" id=\"b6c4\" class=\"graf--h3\">Step 3:</h3><h4 name=\"00ae\" id=\"00ae\" class=\"graf--h4\">Disintermediate Point-of-Sale all together</h4><p name=\"4123\" id=\"4123\" class=\"graf--p graf--empty\"><br/></p><p name=\"a903\" id=\"a903\" class=\"graf--p\">Why do we need a POS in a few years if the phones, themselves are more secure? I suspect that in a few years (or earlier), Apple will unveil a way for the phone to act as a terminal and accept payment from another phone. This would dramatically accelerate the adoption of NFC payment terminals as any merchant with an iPhone (or iPad) would immediately be able to accept ApplePay by going through a simple online on-boarding versus a convoluted, time consuming merchant acquisition process.</p><h3 name=\"5ea8\" id=\"5ea8\" class=\"graf--h3\">Step 4:</h3><h4 name=\"6374\" id=\"6374\" class=\"graf--h4\">Warehouse money flows</h4><p name=\"a5bc\" id=\"a5bc\" class=\"graf--p graf--empty\"><br/></p><p name=\"7498\" id=\"7498\" class=\"graf--p\">This is the arguably the most difficult but most profitable step. If Step 3 takes place, then Apple has a very simple decision to make: what value exists by using the existing rails to essentially transfer money from one iTunes account to another (ie: a user on one iPhone buying something from someone else on another iPhone)? Instead, they would quickly realize that they could entirely eliminate interchange by simply being the centralized database of these transactions and eliminating the concept of a credit card all-together. they can still use the banks to offload and manage risk but they then are consolidating the writing of transactions from disparate banks (and DBs) to one \u201cbank\u201d (Apple) and its DB (iTunes).</p><h3 name=\"1b27\" id=\"1b27\" class=\"graf--h3\">Step 5:</h3><h4 name=\"0bf6\" id=\"0bf6\" class=\"graf--h4\">Take risk</h4><p name=\"f06c\" id=\"f06c\" class=\"graf--p graf--empty\"><br/></p><p name=\"fa85\" id=\"fa85\" class=\"graf--p\">If Apple does any of this, then taking risk and underwriting the transaction itself could become very profitable and obvious. They have your phone, your fingerprint, data on where you are, what you do, what you buy etc so presumably they could do, at a minimum, as good a job as existing players, but most likely a much better job of understanding the risk of every single transaction. in that world, they become a competing \u201cissuer.\u201d</p><blockquote name=\"0e19\" id=\"0e19\" class=\"graf--pullquote pullquote\">Meanwhile, online:</blockquote><p name=\"8719\" id=\"8719\" class=\"graf--p\">What role does Stripe, Braintree, Paypal play in any iOS experience? likely little to none even if these API players integrate with ApplePay. They still have a critical role to play in Android but the iOS opportunity seems quite limited in value. the only issue is the fee that developers would be willing to pay Apple but the tradeoff is simple to model\u200a\u2014\u200ahow much are you willing to pay Apple vs the lift you get from a streamlined purchase flow. if apple is smart and long-term thinking, which i think they are, they will create massive incentives to adopt ApplePay by taking little to no rake so that their fee structure is better for developers/merchants than existing alternatives\u200a\u2014\u200aanother reason why iOS is scorched earth for 3rd parties. when you think about the fact that 30%+ of all mobile traffic in the US is Safari and app traffic from iOS is at least 50%, this is a huge portion of the mobile operating ecosystem that Apple has taken back from 3rd parties.</p><p name=\"a9f3\" id=\"a9f3\" class=\"graf--p\">Lastly, I suspect that as ApplePay rolls out, we start to see a market consolidation with Google being the most aggressive acquirer. Google will need to figure out which components it would need as a platform layer in Android and go and buy those as it seems they haven\u2019t been able to build those thusfar. Stripe for abstractions; Square for merchant acquisition etc.</p><p name=\"24b6\" id=\"24b6\" class=\"graf--p graf--last\">No matter what, ApplePay is a big positive for consumers who should ultimately benefit from more seamless transaction experiences both offline and online, better risk management, better loyalty programs and lower fraud potential. And Apple benefits by creating something awesome and giving themselves the option value to completely take over a trillion dollar market in a few years.</p></div></div></body></html>",

When designing a messaging application for the Apple Watch there are several key considerations that must be kept in mind to ensure developers are creating something people will actually use.</p>\r\n<h2>Is the Apple Watch Worthy?</h2>\r\n<p>Jonathan Ive\u2019s team developed the Apple Watch to help solve the problem they themselves created: smartphone addiction. Between the constant influx of notifications and the 24/7 connectivity to work, we are prisoners of our own devices.</p>\r\n<p>Reluctantly, I\u2019ll admit that I\u2019m guilty of this in my personal life. As I play with my kids on a Saturday afternoon in the park, I can\u2019t help but discreetly sneak a look at my phone every few minutes. We just cannot free ourselves from the thought of missing something important.</p>\r\n<p>While critics claim otherwise, the Apple Watch actually frees us from our constant surreptitious phone-checking habit. By filtering the most important alerts and providing immediate notifications that can be absorbed with a glance, the Apple Watch causes users to pick up their phone less frequently and only for matters that involve a response.</p>\r\n<div class=\"writerquote-wrap left pullquote-left\"><blockquote class=\"writerquote\">Between the constant influx of notifications and the 24/7 connectivity to work, we are prisoners of our own devices.</blockquote></div>\r\n<p>Given the nature and purpose of the Apple Watch, the first question companies should ask is whether or not their business app interaction is worthy of immediate interruption. For enterprise messaging, the answer is a resounding Yes. The instant nature of messaging lends itself naturally for a new communication medium like the Apple Watch.</p>\r\n<h2>Starting From Scratch</h2>\r\n<p>Just like every app does not belong on the Apple Watch, every iPhone interface will not transfer\u00a0to the face of a wristwatch.\u00a0Over-simplification is important. You may think your iPhone app is sleek and simple, but everything changes when you drastically reduce the screen size.</p>\r\n<p>Simplifying isn\u2019t just about design; it\u2019s about reducing the number of available features on the app. Many of the browsing or text-heavy portions of a smartphone platform are no longer applicable on the watch form factor, requiring developers to determine which features are used the most and\u00a0eliminate the rest.</p>\r\n<p>Color palettes on the Apple Watch also matter. Despite the assumption that a color palette would be the easiest part of the Apple Watch transition, it usually cannot be replicated from the smartphone. The Apple Watch\u2019s black background and small screen size completely change the game, meaning that the de-saturated colors often used in traditional branding appear muted and are difficult to read, which forces designers to switch over to bright, high-contrast colors.</p>\r\n<h2>The Need For Context-Intelligent Responses</h2>\r\n<p>First and foremost, the Apple Watch is a notification platform. Punching out a lengthy message isn\u2019t feasible without a keyboard, so messaging apps face a unique challenge not met by notification-based platforms. As we worked to solve this problem, we kept coming back to one central theme: speed.</p>\r\n<p>Apple Watch users should be able to glance down at their wrist, instantly absorb the information they need and move on with their day. This is why Apple\u2019s User Interface Guidelines suggest that app developers keep all interactions with the watch to less than 30 seconds.</p>\r\n<p>With a 30-second time constraint, how do you empower users to read a notification and reply, while avoiding the often-awkward voice response? We focused on context-intelligent emojis and canned text responses to reply quickly. While the basic forms of both of these technologies have been available for years, they lacked context and the ability to accurately predict a user\u2019s reply. That\u2019s beginning to change.</p>\r\n<p>Right now, enterprise messaging applications offer a series of canned responses, such as \u201cYes, I\u2019m available now\u201d or \u201cWe closed the deal.\u201d Eventually, messaging applications will be able to gather relevant data to enable the creation of personalized and relevant response options.</p>\r\n<p>For example, if a colleague asks to do lunch at 1pm, the app could gather information from a user\u2019s calendar, current location, past preferences and outside data (such as access to OpenTable) to suggest personalized responses, such as\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not available until 1:30. Let\u2019s meet at Salt House on Mission Street. They have tables available at that time.\u201d</p>\r\n<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>\r\n<p>With the recent watchOS 2 announcement, which will support native apps as well as third-party complications, it is clear Apple views enriched third-party apps as critical to delivering a fully integrated wearable experience. Still, the full potential of messaging apps will not be realized until the Apple Watch can function without the iPhone.</p>\r\n<p>Independent of this crutch, and with the capabilities of everything from instant communication to project management, the Apple Watch stands to become the ultimate convener, allowing users to seamlessly manage both their personal and professional lives.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n</div></body></html>",

If you want to describe sex, write a book or a song, or create a medical App. It can get complicated, but we have decided to not allow certain kinds of content in the App Store. It may help to keep some of our broader themes in mind:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"square\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>We have lots of kids downloading lots of Apps. Parental controls work great to protect kids, but you have to do your part too. So know that we're keeping an eye out for the kids.</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>We have over a million Apps in the App Store. If your App doesn't do something useful, unique or provide some form of lasting entertainment, or if your app is plain creepy, it may not be accepted.</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>If your App looks like it was cobbled together in a few days, or you're trying to get your first practice App into the store to impress your friends, please brace yourself for rejection. We have lots of serious developers who don't want their quality Apps to be surrounded by amateur hour.</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>We will reject Apps for any content or behavior that we believe is over the line. What line, you ask? Well, as a Supreme Court Justice once said, \"I'll know it when I see it\". And we think that you will also know it when you cross it.</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>If your App is rejected, we have a Review Board that you can appeal to. If you run to the press and trash us, it never helps.</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>If you attempt to cheat the system (for example, by trying to trick the review process, steal data from users, copy another developer's work, or manipulate the ratings) your Apps will be removed from the store and you will be expelled from the developer program.</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>This is a living document, and new Apps presenting new questions may result in new rules at any time. Perhaps your App will trigger this.</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"thirteen\">Lastly, we love this stuff too, and honor what you do. We're really trying our best to create the best platform in the world for you to express your talents and make a living too. If it sounds like we're control freaks, well, maybe it's because we're so committed to our users and making sure they have a quality experience with our products. Just like almost all of you are, too.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"subhead\">Table of Contents</h2>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"subhead\" id=\"terms-conditions\">1.

If you\u2019re in the mobile app space, it\u2019s important to understand the various methods for marketing your app. We\u2019d like to share with you one very important technique that continues to be overlooked by most \u2013 app store optimization (or ASO for short).</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.kissmetrics.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/LearnAboutApps-1.png\" alt=\"New Mobile App Discovery Methods\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-20948\"/></p>\r\n<p align=\"center\"><i>More apps are discovered through search than any other method</i></p>\r\n<h2>So, what is ASO?</h2>\r\n<p>ASO is the process of optimizing mobile apps to rank higher in an app store\u2019s search results. The higher your app ranks in an app store\u2019s search results, the more visible it is to potential customers. That increased visibility tends to translate into more traffic to your app\u2019s page in the app store.</p>\r\n<p><i>The goal of ASO is to drive more traffic to your app\u2019s page in the app store, so searchers can take a specific action:<b> downloading your app.</b></i></p>\r\n<p>Also, the ASO process requires a <i><span>crucial understanding</span></i> of your target customer base, including the keywords your potential customers are using to find apps similar to yours. When you learn more about which keywords are being used, you will have a better understanding of the language of your potential customers \u2013 a crucial piece of any marketing plan \u2013 and you can home in on your keyword choices.</p>\r\n<h2>Why is ASO important?</h2>\r\n<p>According to Forrester, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/17/forrester-app-discovery-report/\">63% of apps are discovered through app store </a><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/17/forrester-app-discovery-report/\">searches</a>. This makes search, <i>in the app store</i>, the most used method for discovering and downloading new apps. Recently, at Google I/O, Ankit Jain reported that \u201c<a href=\"http://www.insidemobileapps.com/2013/05/17/google-discloses-how-search-for-google-play-works-for-the-first-time-12-percent-of-dau-search-for-apps-daily/\">For the average app, search actually makes up the vast majority of installs.</a>\u201d Simply put, this means that:</p>\r\n<p><b><i>If you\u2019re not using ASO to increase your app\u2019s search ranking, you\u2019re missing out on the largest discovery channel available to your app.</i></b></p>\r\n<p>With hundreds of thousands of apps in each app store vying to rank above one another, the amazing reality is that the majority of publishers are not investing in app store optimization. So here\u2019s our gift to you: ASO is your secret weapon. Spend time every week improving your ASO, and you will meaningfully impact your app\u2019s ranking and overall success.</p>\r\n<h2>What are the mechanics of ASO?</h2>\r\n<p>Let\u2019s start by breaking down the various components that can affect your ASO:</p>\r\n<h3>Main Factors:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><b>Title</b> \u2013 The keyword placed in the title should be the one with the heaviest search traffic. Spend time researching which keyword that is, because changing your title often to include different keywords can be detrimental. As your app begins to rank higher and gain more reviews, news of your app will begin to spread by word of mouth. Changing the title can make it difficult for word to spread about your app.</li>\r\n<li><b>Keywords</b> \u2013 To improve your search rankings, you need to know which keywords are relevant and used most often by your target audience. It is helpful to monitor competitors in order to realize how you compare week to week.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In addition to being the most important factors for ASO, the fact that the title and keywords can be modified easily means that you can regularly optimize them.</p>\r\n<h3>Secondary Factors:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><b>Total # of Downloads</b> \u2013 Your number of downloads are extremely important to ASO, but you don\u2019t have complete control over them.</li>\r\n<li><b>Ratings and Reviews</b> \u2013 Also important and difficult to control. However, there are ways to incentivize happy users to rate and review.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Let\u2019s Talk About Keywords in the Title: Worth It?</h2>\r\n<p>With a sampling of keywords, they looked at the top 25 ranking positions and calculated what percentage of apps had the keyword in the title vs. those that did not. This provided a total aggregate score for the apps with the keyword in the title and the apps without the keyword in the title.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.kissmetrics.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/KeywordsInTitle.png\" alt=\"Keywords in title\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-20949\"/></p>\r\n<p>Based on this test, apps with keywords in the title ranked on average 10.3% higher than those without a keyword in the title.</p>\r\n<p>So, is a keyword worth placing in your title? <b>Yes</b>.</p>\r\n<h2>Do apps with higher ratings rank higher in search results?</h2>\r\n<p>This test was done by taking a random sampling of keywords and categorizing them by difficulty as related to result count. An \u201ceasy\u201d keyword results in fewer than 25 apps trying to rank for that keyword. \u201cMedium\u201d keywords are those that are included in 25-100 apps, and \u201ccompetitive\u201d keywords are those in 100+ apps.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.kissmetrics.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/RatingsRankings.png\" alt=\"How app ratings correlate to search rankings\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-20950\"/></p>\r\n<p>Based on this test, there is a clear trend showing that apps with higher ratings also rank higher for keyword difficulty.</p>\r\n<p>Do apps with better ratings rank higher? <b>Yes</b>.</p>\r\n<p>(But don\u2019t beg for them; earn <a href=\"http://www.apptentive.com/blog/better-ratings-for-your-applications/\">better ratings for your apps</a> the right way.)</p>\r\n<h2>Do more downloads correlate to higher app store search rankings?</h2>\r\n<p>Only the developer and the app store know the number of times an app has been downloaded. Since we do not know the number of downloads, we took the number of ratings instead. The belief here is that, averaged out, the download-to-rating conversion rate is more or less similar across most apps. Therefore, it is fairly accurate to look at the number of ratings as a proxy for the number of downloads.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.kissmetrics.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DownloadsRankings.png\" alt=\"How downloads correlate to search rankings\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-20951\"/></p>\r\n<p>Again, the results of the test are clear. The trend, regardless of difficulty, showed that apps with more downloads also rank higher.</p>\r\n<p>Do apps with more downloads rank higher? <b>Yes</b>.</p>\r\n<p>It is important to notice the difference between \u201ccompetitive\u201d keywords and the other difficulties. If your keyword falls into the \u201ccompetitive\u201d category, you need a significantly larger number of downloads to rank higher.</p>\r\n<h2>Keep in mind that ASO takes time</h2>\r\n<p>ASO is a process that needs to be monitored and constantly tweaked over a period of time. Your optimal set of keywords rarely is the set that you first opt to put in the app store.</p>\r\n<p>Today, the most common approach to ASO is no approach at all. Developers often pick keywords and write descriptions at the last second during an app\u2019s submission process. In most cases, little or no research on keyword searches occurs before the app submission, leaving most apps hidden and the likelihood of discovery quite low.</p>\r\n<p>We had a moment to sit down with Ian Sefferman, the CEO of MobileDevHQ, and he told us how investing time in ASO has affected their customers. He said:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>\u201cASO is having dramatic effects on our client apps. For those who put the time in to understand, iterate, and test, we\u2019ve seen many apps increase their downloads by a factor of 2x-10x, and an increase of revenue by a similar, or bigger, rate due to the increase in engagement of users earned by ASO. ASO is not a simple process, and you might not see the impact overnight, but if you\u2019re willing to invest in it, the outcome can be incredibly worthwhile.\u201d</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>App developers need to consistently track their own rankings and the rankings of their competitors over time. More apps are published every day, and the constant stream of new ratings, reviews, and downloads can affect your search rankings. Keep testing and experimenting with your keywords in order to consistently rank well and drive more traffic to your download page.</p>\r\n<h2>Tips for improving your ASO</h2>\r\n<p>To recap, let\u2019s look at the ASO factors and the methods you can use to improve in those areas.</p>\r\n<h3><i>Main Factors</i></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><b>Title</b> \u2013 Having a keyword in your title can improve your app\u2019s search ranking for that keyword by an average of 10.3%. As a best practice, you want to place your most relevant keyword, regardless of the keyword difficulty, in the title.</li>\r\n<li><b>Keywords</b> \u2013 Constantly tracking your own keywords and the movement of your competitors takes time and effort. In order to have the time to focus on your app and not solely on ASO, use a service such as <a href=\"http://www.mobiledevhq.com\">MobileDevHQ</a> to track your search rankings, analyze your keywords, choose better keywords, and get updates about your competitors.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3><i>Secondary Factors</i></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><b>Total # of Downloads</b> \u2013 Now that our gut feelings have been proven with data, what can you do to get more downloads for your app? Improving your ASO is a great place to start. Beyond that, it is about marketing your brand and app to improve recognition, awareness, and appeal, from app store description to images, ratings/reviews, and social media presence.

This raises a tricky dilemma: you want more ratings and reviews but not if they are negative. So, you need a way to connect with your customers inside your app, giving them a place to vent and talk directly to the developer. On the flip side, you want to guide happy customers to leave positive reviews for you.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>To reap the rewards of ASO, you need to invest time and effort. If you do, you\u2019ll have a consistent channel driving traffic to your app. Being found is one of the most difficult challenges for mobile apps, but it is a problem you can actively solve.</p>\r\n<p><b>About the Author:</b> Robi Ganguly is the CEO of <a href=\"http://www.apptentive.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Apptentive</a>, the easiest way for every company with an app to talk with their customers.

Without further ado:</em></p><p name=\"b059\" id=\"b059\" class=\"graf--p\">There\u2019s already been a fair amount written on the subject on the future of texting and of messaging-as-an-interface. Jonathan Libov had a pretty comprehensive set of ideas that established how a lightweight texting option could replace many of the apps that we deal with today. In the post title \u201c<a href=\"http://whoo.ps/2015/02/23/futures-of-text\" data-href=\"http://whoo.ps/2015/02/23/futures-of-text\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">Futures of Text</a>\u201d he says:</p><blockquote name=\"c8dc\" id=\"c8dc\" class=\"graf--blockquote\">In contrast to a GUI that defines rules for each interaction\u200a\u2014\u200arules which, frustratingly, change from app to app\u200a\u2014\u200atext-based, conversational interactions are liberating in their familiarity. There\u2019s only really only one way to skin this cat: The text I type is displayed on the right, the text someone else typed is on the left, and there\u2019s an input field on bottom for me to compose a message.</blockquote><p name=\"37f4\" id=\"37f4\" class=\"graf--p\">App overload is a real thing. Personally I have 109 apps installed on my iPhone right now, and that\u2019s even after a massive purge about a month ago. I can\u2019t possibly use more than 20% of them on a regular basis. For example, Airbnb, TripIt, Sprig, Lyft, Uber, and Venmo are just a handful of the many apps I need on my phone but don\u2019t use them on a daily basis.</p><p name=\"6f7e\" id=\"6f7e\" data-align=\"center\" class=\"graf--p\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Just yesterday, during the 2015 WWDC keynote, Apple </em><a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/matthewzeitlin/apples-wwdc-by-the-numbers#.bvyJWY48J\" data-href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/matthewzeitlin/apples-wwdc-by-the-numbers#.bvyJWY48J\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">announced</em></a><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\"> that the average iPhone has 119 apps on it. That\u2019s insane!</em></p><p name=\"d15b\" id=\"d15b\" class=\"graf--p\">With that in consideration, the \u201capp\u201d as the sole way I can interface with a service feels unnecessarily heavy handed but rich alternatives don\u2019t exist. As Libov used as an example, <a href=\"http://bustime.mta.info\" data-href=\"http://bustime.mta.info\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">NYC\u2019s MTA Bus Time</a> service makes it easy to just text a number and get bus times without need for a dedicated interface. It\u2019s spartan, though it gets the basic job done. However, if you want anything more than just text you\u2019re shit out of luck.</p><p name=\"946e\" id=\"946e\" class=\"graf--p\">Therein lies the opportunity.</p><h3 name=\"de9a\" id=\"de9a\" class=\"graf--h3\">The end of the graphical user interface</h3><p name=\"c1f2\" id=\"c1f2\" class=\"graf--p\">Do we really believe that the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface\" data-href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">GUI</a> is the end-all-be-all way to interface with a computer? With each new app we need to learn how to use it. Sometimes this can be quick, and intuitive, but oftentimes there is a learning curve associated with it.</p><p name=\"87c1\" id=\"87c1\" class=\"graf--p\">Two years ago Ron Kaplan <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2013/03/conversational-user-interface/\" data-href=\"http://www.wired.com/2013/03/conversational-user-interface/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">wrote an article</a> that begged the same question, and made a suggestion that the next evolution of our interaction with computers is the Conversational User Interface. The article itself was ahead of its time but seems to be extremely prescient for today.</p><h3 name=\"6b0e\" id=\"6b0e\" class=\"graf--h3\">There\u2019s a chat for that</h3><p name=\"a084\" id=\"a084\" class=\"graf--p\">What if instead of installing an app, we might instead allow a service to chat with us via iMessage? From that point on, they\u2019re just like any contact in your phone, enabling a two-way conversation to get things done. With each new conversation you\u2019d give relevant permissions for contact and the moment you\u2019d like to end it then the \u201capp\u201d could no longer message you. Easy!</p><p name=\"d7dc\" id=\"d7dc\" class=\"graf--p\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">It should be noted that when I say \u201cconversation\u201d I don\u2019t mean that you\u2019re just texting with a service (e.g. Magic, Luka, etc.). Likewise a \u201cconversational user interface\u201d isn\u2019t limited to just text.</em></p><figure name=\"3a05\" id=\"3a05\" class=\"graf--figure\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\"><p class=\"aspect-ratio-fill\"/><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*Z84a8BFv8lXeRWLDUoL60g.png\" data-width=\"2484\" data-height=\"2254\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*Z84a8BFv8lXeRWLDUoL60g.png\" src=\"https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*Z84a8BFv8lXeRWLDUoL60g.png\"/></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Example of apps as chats</figcaption></figure><p name=\"4bb9\" id=\"4bb9\" class=\"graf--p\">In the above mockup you can see three different examples of experiences that are currently just apps.

For all of those apps that you might otherwise use just once or twice, you might instead just bring up a conversation.</p><p name=\"fae9\" id=\"fae9\" class=\"graf--p\">Additionally, this kind of experience would make onboarding customers dramatically faster and easier. Each conversation would prompt iOS to ask what kind of information be shared, including perhaps your name, photo, and maybe your address. Payment would all be done through Apple Pay, making for ultra fast and seamless transactions.</p><p name=\"4717\" id=\"4717\" class=\"graf--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">MessageKit</strong> would be similar to Apple\u2019s other *Kits in that it would enable developers to quickly build out an experience based on guides. It would include a permission stack, the ability to create unique input methods, and a way to enable discovery. From a user\u2019s perspective the entire thing would be opt-in. Apps wouldn\u2019t be able to just start messaging you without initiating.</p><h3 name=\"2e03\" id=\"2e03\" class=\"graf--h3\">Imagining what it might look like\u2026</h3></div><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn\"><figure name=\"3d2b\" id=\"3d2b\" class=\"graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\"><p class=\"aspect-ratio-fill\"/><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*StuWkQKniQz9UL2RoTvRCw.png\" data-width=\"4774\" data-height=\"2808\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*StuWkQKniQz9UL2RoTvRCw.png\" src=\"https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/1200/1*StuWkQKniQz9UL2RoTvRCw.png\"/></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--figure-em\">Mockup of what Lyft might look like in a conversational interface, built into the Messages app. The nav bar and response bubbles appear in pink, providing an opportunity for branding.</em></figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"section-inner layoutSingleColumn\"><p name=\"0fed\" id=\"0fed\" class=\"graf--p\">In the above example you can see the user opening up a Lyft conversation for the first time. By tapping the built-in \u201cRequest a ride\u201d button it brings up a unique interactive experience that takes up the area that would otherwise have a keyboard. This would be programmed by the app developers themselves to enable whatever kind of input function they\u2019d like. In this case it\u2019s a UI that helps a user identify their location and quickly request a Lyft.</p><p name=\"e56f\" id=\"e56f\" class=\"graf--p\">From there Lyft could send them a message when their ride is on the way and better yet, have a live updating map that shows where they\u2019re at.</p><p name=\"91b0\" id=\"91b0\" class=\"graf--p\">All of this functionality is built into the Lyft app today, but when you strip away all of the chrome, the package it comes in, the use case is quite simple. Installing an app is sometimes a laborious process. Starting a conversation could make things much simpler.</p><p name=\"7cdd\" id=\"7cdd\" class=\"graf--p\">There are a couple of other things that would be necessary to make this whole thing work: First, we need to assume that NLP (natural language processing) is not yet quite good enough to enable humans to converse with computers effectively. Second we need to assume that the vast majority of companies out there wouldn\u2019t want NLP to become a core competency. Thirdly we need to ensure that the end user can have the best possible experience and enable delight.</p><p name=\"19c2\" id=\"19c2\" class=\"graf--p\">So where does that leave us? Here are some ideas:</p><h3 name=\"f584\" id=\"f584\" class=\"graf--h3\">Mad Libs</h3><figure name=\"8fa1\" id=\"8fa1\" class=\"graf--figure\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\"><p class=\"aspect-ratio-fill\"/><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*-i97l3xkz-bhk5k0YgvBEg.jpeg\" data-width=\"3300\" data-height=\"2550\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*-i97l3xkz-bhk5k0YgvBEg.jpeg\" src=\"https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*-i97l3xkz-bhk5k0YgvBEg.jpeg\"/></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Mad Libs\u00ae example</figcaption></figure><p name=\"5cbb\" id=\"5cbb\" class=\"graf--p\">Do you remember these things? You\u2019d add your own words in to a story, guided by suggestions of using nouns, adjectives, verbs, etc. What if instead of expecting that a user will know the exact way to communicate with a bot, we help them learn the commands via \u201cMad Libs\u201d like experiences? While typing a message a small suggestion box might pop up to guide the phrase a user may be typing out. That way, when on the receiving end of the message, the bot would be able to have a high probability of parsing the message and succeeding at its task.</p><h3 name=\"eae4\" id=\"eae4\" class=\"graf--h3\">Bubbles with buttons</h3><p name=\"4e0b\" id=\"4e0b\" class=\"graf--p\">Messages with built-in options that would activate certain commands would make the conversation even richer. In the above example with Lyft, you can see a \u201cRequest a ride\u201d button directly within a message. It would be easy to imagine a guided experience that might go something like this:</p><blockquote name=\"5492\" id=\"5492\" class=\"graf--blockquote\">Customer: I\u2019d like a pizza delivered right now<br/><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--blockquote-em\">Dominos: How big? [Small] [Medium] [Large]</em></strong><br/>Customer: *selects Medium*<br/><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--blockquote-em\">Dominos: What kind of toppings? [Pepperoni] [Sausage] [See More]</em></strong></blockquote><p name=\"7904\" id=\"7904\" class=\"graf--p\">You get the picture\u2026just a series of pointed questions with a series of taps to get where you need to. Dead simple. Understood by all and no need to build a complicated app to get the job done.</p><p name=\"d674\" id=\"d674\" class=\"graf--p\">Eventually the buttons might go beyond just text and include more complex interactions, but simple phrases are probably a good start.</p><h3 name=\"9a7b\" id=\"9a7b\" class=\"graf--h3\">Siri</h3><p name=\"2a58\" id=\"2a58\" class=\"graf--p\">Whether we realize it or not, some of us are already having a conversation with our iPhones: with Siri. So what if developers could plug directly into Siri by way of MessageKit and enable users to just dictate what they want!</p><blockquote name=\"273c\" id=\"273c\" class=\"graf--blockquote\">User: Siri, get me a Lyft<br/><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--blockquote-em\">Siri: Where would you like to be picked up? [Brings up a map]</em><br/></strong>User: Here<br/><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--blockquote-em\">Siri: Great! Lyft will let you know when your ride is on its way.</em></strong></blockquote><h3 name=\"d4ca\" id=\"d4ca\" class=\"graf--h3\">Conclusion</h3><p name=\"ebfe\" id=\"ebfe\" class=\"graf--p\">Obviously much of this is blue sky thinking, but to me it just seems inevitable. Why in the world do I need hundreds of apps on my phone just to get some simple things done? Why do each of those apps need a completely unique experience that might hinder my ability to even do what the app intends? Instead, pulling up a conversation and getting something done quickly and efficiently seems like a more delightful experience to me.</p><p name=\"ebe3\" id=\"ebe3\" class=\"graf--p\">I\u2019ve said in a <a href=\"https://medium.com/@mg/the-graphical-user-interface-will-soon-give-way-to-the-rise-of-the-conversational-user-interface-ba8cc52f945b\" data-href=\"https://medium.com/@mg/the-graphical-user-interface-will-soon-give-way-to-the-rise-of-the-conversational-user-interface-ba8cc52f945b\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">previous post</a> that I believe the folks that inhabit the messaging space and those that embrace the conversational user interface will be big winners in the future\u200a\u2014\u200afolks like <a href=\"https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2015/03/25/introducing-messenger-platform-and-businesses-on-messenger/\" data-href=\"https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2015/03/25/introducing-messenger-platform-and-businesses-on-messenger/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://layer.com\" data-href=\"https://layer.com\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">Layer</a>, <a href=\"http://joinassist.com\" data-href=\"http://joinassist.com\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">Assist</a>*. But the big opportunity here could be Apple enabling an entirely new class of experiences, breaking down barriers and focusing on delight. MessageKit can and should be Apple\u2019s next big platform play.</p><p name=\"fc62\" id=\"fc62\" class=\"graf--p graf--last\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">*Of note: I\u2019m an advisor to Assist</em></p></div></div></div></body></html>",
